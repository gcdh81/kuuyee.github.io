    Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
    Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
    the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.
    
    If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
    Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
    are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.
    
    If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
    working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
    problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
    Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
    as well.
    
    If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
    the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.
    

**解决办法**
在+Vagrant+配置文件中加入Vagrant用户名和密码：

    wcdb.ssh.username = "vagrant"
    wcdb.ssh.password = "vagrant"
